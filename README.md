# Summer project 2018
Thank you for visiting. This is the code behind my first wesbite and the focus of my summer project for 2018.
The website will present my resume, along with links to all of my projects.
The website has turned into a two stage project:

The website was originally built using only HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.
This was done to show my basic fundamental knowledge of each topic.
This, however, is only a temporary rendition of the website.
(This part is still live while the next part is built and will be able to be linked back to from the main page).

The new version of the website will incorperate ReactJS as the front end control of the website.
The back end will be controlled by NodeJS. 
Both of these parts will be updated to the project as I learn more about each language. 
This is done to show how my basic knowlegde of JS, CSS, and HTML has allowed me to overall improve the quality of the project.
A lot of style changes, control, and look, along with a working login database and chatroom will be added.

The overall goal of the website was to fully immersify myself in basic web development fundamentals, 
while progressing into the new, more commonly used practices of today, so I can be ready for any and all web development
opportunities in the future
